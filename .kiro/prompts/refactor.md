## Code Review Integration Instructions

A code review has been generated by another AI agent. You will find it here: tmp/codeReview.md. This reviewing agent has a strong understanding of project rules and coding standards, but lacks the full context of our implementation session, including the specific requirements, design decisions, and trade-offs we've discussed.

### Your Task:

1. **Read and Analyze**: Review all suggestions from the code review file carefully.

2. **Context-Aware Evaluation**: For each suggestion, consider:
   - Our original requirements and the reasoning behind implementation decisions
   - Whether the suggestion improves code quality without conflicting with our goals
   - If there are valid context-specific reasons why our current approach is preferable
   - Project rules and standards (where the review agent has better insight)
   - Potential risks or unintended consequences

3. **Provide Recommendations**: Categorize each suggestion:
   - ✅ **Implement**: Valuable improvement that aligns with our goals
   - ⚠️ **Discuss**: Has merit but needs clarification given our context
   - ❌ **Skip**: Conflicts with requirements or context-specific decisions

4. **Justify Your Assessment**: Explain your reasoning for each decision, especially when suggesting to skip items or when you see conflicts between the review and our established approach.

5. **Request Approval**: Present your analysis and wait for my explicit confirmation before implementing any changes.

6. **Execute Refactoring**: Once approved, implement the accepted changes while maintaining consistency with our overall implementation.

Remember: You have the full context of our session. Trust your understanding of our requirements while respecting valid code quality and standards improvements suggested by the review.
